# SuperChat - Rocket.Chat Flutter client

## Getting Started

Inspired by rocket-chat-connector-flutter, it is a flutter-based Rocet.chat client written from scratch.
Android and web have been tested, but iOS has not been built. Looking for someone to help with iOS.

You can try the web version directly from the url below.
Currently, only Google sign-in is supported.
For firebase and google login, google-services.json is required.
The detailed build method will be posted later.
